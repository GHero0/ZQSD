ZQSD is a platformer game developped as a java software projet at [ENSSAT](https://enssat.fr/) in 2025. The goal of this project is mainly to learn how to use Java while still having fun with it. As so the game uses only Swing and no external libraries. 

**Bellow, you'll find an installation guide to install the project.** But feel free to fork the project and make your own game with it. 




# üì• Installation Guide 

For now the game is usable via the command line or the Makefile.

## üìã Prerequisite

Java 8 or higher is required to run the game. You can check your version with the following command:

```bash
java -version
```
If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GHero0/ZQSD.git
```

## üéÆ Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ZQSD
```

2. Compile the project using the Makefile:

```bash
make compile
```

3. Run the game:

If you're on Windows, the Makefile will work just fine. On Linux, you will need to modify the Makefile as follows:

From : 

```makefile
# Run the main class
.PHONY: run
run: compile
	@echo "Running $(MAIN_CLASS)"
	powershell.exe -Command "& { java -cp '$(BIN_DIR);$(ASSETS_DIR)' $(MAIN_CLASS) }"
```

To : 

```makefile
# Run the main class
.PHONY: run
run: compile
	@echo "Running $(MAIN_CLASS)"
	java -cp '$(BIN_DIR):$(ASSETS_DIR)' $(MAIN_CLASS)
```

Finally to run the game, use the following command:


```bash
make run
```
